## How to use
Adjust the toolchain path in build.sh and Makefile to match the path on your system. 

Run build.sh and follow the prompts, alternatively you can use a command line:

-	./build.sh 0  will perform Clean Workspace
-	./build.sh 00 will perform Clean CCACHE
-	./build.sh 1  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img for S7
-	./build.sh 2  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img for S7 Edge
-	./build.sh 3  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img for S7 + S7 Edge
-	./build.sh 4  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img and .zip for S7
-	./build.sh 5  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img and .zip for S7 Edge
-	./build.sh 6  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img and .zip for S7 + S7 Edge (Seperate)
-	./build.sh 7  will perform Build TGPKernel boot.img and .zip for S7 + S7 Edge (All-In-One)

When finished, the new .img and / or .zip file will be created in the output directory.

If Java is installed, the .zip files will be automatically signed.
